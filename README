	Libhak - A library of handy tools for C programmers.

	IN BRIEF

	libhak is a collection of convenience functions often needed
	by C programmers.  Things like linked structures such as lists and trees,
	operations on queues and stacks, checking for system calls' errors,
	processing command line options and so on.  They are ready at hand with
	libhak.  And there is no more excuses to coding in some other "easy" language.

	Warning:

	As of this writing Libhak is a work on progress in its early alpha 
	stage. That means: things may not work and the source is only useful
	for the library's developers.


	THE WHOLE HISTORY

	Libhak may stand for either "Handy Army Knife" or "Hackers Army Knife",
	if you feel like geek-style acronyms, or maybe a phonetic contraction for 
	"HAppy HAcKing", in honor of GNU gurus. 

	And the history begins more or less like this...

	Once upon a time there was a small library...  (to be continued).
